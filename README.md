## New Features Added

### 1Ô∏è. Get Total Number of Registered People (Solidity)

#### Description:
A new view function was added to the smart contract to allow external applications (like the frontend) to retrieve the **total number of registered users** on the platform.

#### Code Added in `blockbase.sol`:

```solidity
// NEW FUNCTION
function getTotalRegisteredUsers() public view returns (uint256) {
    return registeredPeople.length;
}
```

### 2. Display Total Registered Users (React Frontend)

#### Description:
The JS was updated to fetch the total number of registered users from the smart contract and display it in the user interface.

``` JS
const totalUsers = await contract.methods.getTotalRegisteredUsers().call();
setTotalUsers(totalUsers);
<p>Total Registered Users: {totalUsers}</p>
```
